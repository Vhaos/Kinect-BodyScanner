#ScanMeasureWrapper
This is a simple program that acts as a wrapper to the ScanMeasure software.
The ScanMeasure has a small bug that causes it print out the wrong height in the 
xml file but the correct one in the console. This program reads the console and 
prints a separate xml file with correct measurements.
